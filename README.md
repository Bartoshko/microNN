# MicroNN
micro simplistic neuro-network, no instalation needed, just include Net.h in your project.
## Motivations?
This microNN neuro-network is written thanks to bunch of people that are sharing there knowlage in free tutorials.
This microNN is written for fun and for fun only, there is no specific porpouse or implementation it has been written for.
### There are plenty of Open-Source NeuroNetworks, so why writhing your own?
Topic of NN is very interesting and of course I would recomend to use the best avaliable tool that is on the market, this is not a competitive NN, yet ;), but just a project to allow me to better understand the subject of machine learning and deep learnig.
Quoting Richard Feynman: What You can't create you can't understand.
### Is critique neccessary?
Yes! But don't expect that sugestions will be implemented. This is just fun fun fun project.
### Why C++?
It is compiled language so it is fast. And it scalability is good.
There is a lot of power with going closer to the machine level. And I want to use it with resonable speed and memory managment on my raspberry pi zero... so project can grow in this direction. Who knows?
# Structure
MocroNN is fead forward supervised network with back propagation with error correction learning rule with pultilayer preceptor. Preseptor has hiperbolic tangent activation functon.
### What next:
Introducing more activation functions for preceptron - called neuron in this project.
