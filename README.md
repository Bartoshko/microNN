# microNN
micro simplistic neuro-network
## Motivations?
This microNN neuro-network is written thanks to bunch of people that are sharing there knowlage in free tutorials.
This microNN is written for fun and for fun only, there is no specific porpouse or implementation it has been written for.
### There are plenty of Open-Source NeuroNetworks, so why writhing your own?
Topic of NN is very interesting and of course I would recomend to use the best avaliable tool that is on the market, this is not a competitive NN, yet ;), but just a project to allow me to better understand the subject of machine learning and deep learnig.
Quoting Richard Feynman: What You can't create you can't understand.
### Is critique neccessary?
Yes! But don't expect that sugestions will be implemented. This is just fun fun fun project.
### Why C++?
It is compiled language, fast, damn fast, and runs without interpreters, so it's damn fast.
And it scalability is damn good.
An You can mess a lot so think, then think, then think again and than maybe code. Or may not?
There is lot of power going closer with Your code to machine. And I want to use it with resonable power on my raspberry pi zero... so project can grow in this direction. Who knows?
