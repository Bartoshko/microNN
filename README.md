# microNN
micro simplistic neuro-network
## Motivations?
This microNN neuro-network is written thanks to bunch of tutorial that are avaliable free in the internet.
Please fill free to fork, change code, comment, and implement to your projects.
I will try to list the whole releted free avaliable tutorials or code refs that has been used durring creation of this NN.
### There are plenty of Open-Source NeuroNetworks, so why writhing your own?
Topic of NN is very interesting and of course I would recomend to use the best avaliable tool that is on the market, this is not a competitive NN, but just a project to allow me to better understand the sobject of machine learning and deep learnig.
Quoting Richard Feynman: What You can't create you can't understand.
### Is critique neccessary?
But don't expect that sugestions will be implemented. This is just fun fun fun project.
### Why C++?
It is compiled language, fast, damn fast, and runs without interpreters, so it's damn fast.
And it scalability is damn good.
An You can mess a lot so think, then think, then think again and than maybe code. Or may not?
