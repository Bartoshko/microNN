# MicroNN
micro simplistic neuro-network, no installation needed, just include Net.h in your project.
## Motivations?
This microNN neuro-network is written thanks to bunch of people that are sharing there knowledge in free tutorials.
This microNN is written for fun and for fun only, there is no specific purpose or implementation it has been written for.
### There are plenty of Open-Source NeuroNetworks, so why writhing your own?
Topic of NN is very interesting and of course I would recommend to use the best available tool that is on the market, this is not a competitive NN, yet ;), but just a project to allow me to better understand the subject of machine learning and deep learning.
Quoting Richard Feynman: What You can't create you can't understand. So there you go...
### Is critique necessary?
Yes! But don't expect that suggestions will be implemented. This is just fun fun fun project.
### Why C++?
It is compiled language so it is fast. And it scalability is good.
There is a lot of power with going closer to the machine level. And I want to use it with reasonable speed and memory management on my raspberry pi zero... so project can grow in this direction. Who knows?
# Structure
MocroNN is feed forward supervised network. Back propagation has error correction learning rule and multilayer preceptor. Preceptor has hyperbolic tangent activation function.
### What next:
Introducing more activation functions for preceptor - called neuron in this project.
